## graphs-algorithms

Application that implements some graphs algorithms and graph operations.

### Requirements

* JDK 1.8

### Running the applications locally

Each package of the project contains a different implementation of one graph algorithm, the App class is the main class that contains a graph with static data to run the algorithm.
